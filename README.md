# Asthma-Detection-Model
In this Project we used the mdeical data from BRFSS platform of the 2014 annual health report.
After collecting the data we cleaned and preprocessed the data using the r language.
After cleaning the data we implement the Machine Learning Algorithms Such as SVM ,KNN, Random forest etc..
we split the data into training and testing portion.
After performing this we evaluated the evaluation matrices of the algorithm and using the validation dataset we calculated the accuracy of the model.
